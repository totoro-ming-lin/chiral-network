      "summary": "Team Turtle was the most prolific contributor this semester, with Jake Mallen leading as the top individual contributor across all teams. Their primary focus was on core file transfer infrastructure and protocol implementation. Jake implemented critical features including FTP protocol support, WebRTC data channel improvements, BitTorrent download functionality, and multi-seeder retry handling. The team fixed numerous bugs related to file downloads, chunk handling, and network synchronization. David Lai contributed significantly to FTP integration, fixing download bars, file discovery, and upload functionality. Alexander Joukov added auto-start functionality for DHT and Geth nodes, prevented duplicate seeder entries, and improved build times. The team also worked on mining rewards, Ethereum contract integration, ED2K protocol support, and wallet synchronization. Their debugging efforts included extensive logging for WebRTC transfers, fixing race conditions, and resolving deadlocks in the download system.",

Ming Lin was the primary contributor, fixing critical bootstrap issues, preventing bootstrap nodes from advertising on relay, implementing LRU-style eviction for relays, and adding UDP transport support. He also fixed mDNS peer discovery, disabled UDP temporarily to stabilize downloads, and improved headless CLI functionality. Aaron Purnawan implemented graceful Geth shutdown and fixed overly aggressive corruption detection. Angela Lee fixed search history dropdown clipping and contributed to DHT-related work. Brian Lin moved protocol selection to settings and updated documentation. Ethan Diep added UI and functionality for canceled downloads in download history and fixed reactivity issues.
