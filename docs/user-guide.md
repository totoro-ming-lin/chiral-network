   - Wallet creation (optional)

### First Launch

On first launch, the application will:

- Create default storage directory
- Connect to DHT network
- Detect your region automatically
- Apply default settings

## Main Interface

**FTP Upload** (when FTP protocol is selected):

- **FTP Server Required**: FTP upload requires access to an external FTP server
- Most users should use P2P protocols (WebRTC, Bitswap, BitTorrent) which don't need a server
- Configure FTP server settings:
  - FTP Server URL (e.g., `ftp://ftp.example.com/uploads/`)
  - Username (optional, defaults to anonymous)
  - Password (optional)
  - Use FTPS (FTP over TLS) for secure connection
  - Passive Mode (recommended for firewall compatibility)
- Test connection before uploading to verify settings
- How to get FTP access:
  - Web hosting providers (shared hosting, VPS)
  - University/company FTP servers
  - Local FTP server for testing: `python -m pyftpdlib`

### Managing Uploads

**View uploaded files**:

- File name and size
- Content hash
- Number of seeders
- Upload status

**Actions**:

- Copy hash to clipboard
- Remove from sharing (stop seeding)
- View file details

## FTP Server Integration

Chiral Network supports uploading files to external FTP servers and managing FTP server bookmarks for quick access.
